# Building Blocks

<!-- From @lernapps/app-templates 5799517 (the generic part and the interactive extension): lernapps update replaces this file except the app sections, between <!-- app: begin … --> and <!-- app: end … -->, which hold the app's own architecture. -->

The generic part has three roots that every app shares, whatever its archetype: the shared runtime of
`@lernapps/app-templates`, the tooling helpers of `@lernapps/tooling` and the skills the app commits. Each archetype's extension adds the rest of
level 1 (`quiz/docs/arc42/`, `explainer/docs/arc42/`, `interactive/docs/arc42/`): its runtime `bb-archetype-runtime`
with the parts `bb-build`, `bb-validation`, `bb-render`, `bb-shell`, `bb-e2e` and `bb-runtime-texts`, which every
extension defines under these ids, and the parts the creator writes, one of which provides `if-archetype-content`.
Parts that only some archetypes have (component rules, question types, tutor handoff, task numbers, exercise contract)
are in the extensions that use them. Not built and not in the frame now: a loading indicator (`dec-no-size-limit`) and
a settings dialog (`dec-no-settings`).

Paths are relative to the root of `lernapps/app-templates`. The parts in a template folder carry their path with the
folder as prefix (`interactive/src/core`); an app that gets this architecture as a copy has them without it
(`src/core`). An app's architecture is this part followed by its archetype's extension, chapter by chapter; so the
level-1 view of a whole app is in its extension.

## Shared runtime

Built. The code the archetypes' runtimes share: the page trees, German at the root and every other language below
`/<language>/`, with alternates, a language switch of plain links and the 404 page, which leads every address the
app does not have to its start page (`pages.ts`); learner texts by language (`languages.ts`); the examples check,
which runs an exercise's accepted and rejected examples through the check the page uses, for the quiz and the
explainer (`examples.ts`); the content as YAML, with its problems placed at file, line and path, the errors of a schema
as problems and the checks of the texts (`content.ts`); restricted Markdown and formulas (`text/`); the checks of the
code of Vue components (`vue-code.ts`); HTML escaping (`html.ts`); the frame of every page, with its colours in the light and the dark scheme, its header with the language switch and its footer (`page.css`, `pages.ts`); the content blocks (`blocks/`); the questions, their six types with checker, schema, validation, rendering, engine, end-to-end
helpers and texts, which the quiz and the explainer's exercises both use (`questions/`); Vue at build for the archetypes with components (`vue.ts`); and the app's name, the prefix
of what it stores (`appname.ts`). The app never edits it.

:::
:::building-block
id: bb-runtime
title: Shared runtime
technology: TypeScript
implements: concept-languages, concept-readable-without-js
:::
```

### Shared runtime modules

The archetype's runtime imports them at build and in its tests.

```arc42
:::ignore H014 installed package @lernapps/app-templates (arc42 cannot resolve untracked paths, docToolchain/arc42-language#128)
:::
:::interface
id: if-shared-runtime
title: Page trees, languages, examples check, Vue at build
provider: bb-runtime
protocol: TypeScript imports (runtime/shared)
:::
```

### Content blocks

Built in the shared runtime, for every archetype that shows content with its questions or on its pages: prose, a
formula, a figure (drawn from data, or a bundled image of `src/images/`), a labelled figure, a table, a quotation and
program code, with the credit of an image or a quotation. Their types, their schema, their checks (what the schema
cannot say, every text complete in the declared languages), their rendering at build and their look; the quiz shows
them as the `material` of a question, the explainer as blocks of a page.

```arc42
:::ignore H014 installed package @lernapps/app-templates (arc42 cannot resolve untracked paths, docToolchain/arc42-language#128)
:::
:::building-block
id: bb-blocks
title: Content blocks
parent: bb-runtime
technology: TypeScript
:::
```

#### Content blocks interface

The validation and the rendering of an archetype with content blocks use their types, checks and renderer.

```arc42
:::ignore H014 installed package @lernapps/app-templates (arc42 cannot resolve untracked paths, docToolchain/arc42-language#128)
:::
:::interface
id: if-blocks
title: The content blocks (checkMaterial, renderMaterial, materialIn)
provider: bb-blocks
protocol: TypeScript imports (runtime/shared/blocks), @lernapps/app-templates/blocks
:::
```

### Questions

Built in the shared runtime, for every archetype that has questions: the six question types and what counts as a right
answer, at build, in the browser and in the tests alike, with their schema, validation, rendering, engine, end-to-end
helpers and texts. The quiz asks them; the explainer's quiz-type exercises and the answers of its generated exercises
use the same. Neither archetype imports the other.

```arc42
:::ignore H014 installed package @lernapps/app-templates (arc42 cannot resolve untracked paths, docToolchain/arc42-language#128)
:::
:::building-block
id: bb-questions
title: Questions
parent: bb-runtime
technology: TypeScript
:::
```

#### Questions interface

The validation, the rendering, the client module and the tests of an archetype with questions use their types,
rendering, engine and checker.

```arc42
:::ignore H014 installed package @lernapps/app-templates (arc42 cannot resolve untracked paths, docToolchain/arc42-language#128)
:::
:::interface
id: if-questions
title: The question types, rendering, engine and checker
provider: bb-questions
protocol: TypeScript imports (runtime/shared/questions), @lernapps/app-templates/questions
:::
```

### Component rules

Built in the shared runtime, for every archetype that has Vue components: code checks on the SFC compiler's output of a
component and the modules of the app it imports (no network, no `eval`, `innerHTML` or `v-html`, imports only from Vue,
the runtime, the storage, i18n and a11y helpers and the app's own modules, never from a URL, browser globals only once
mounted). Which modules are the app's own is the archetype's scope: the explainer's components import their own folder,
the interactive archetype's any file of `src/` and the libraries of its `package.json`.

```arc42
:::ignore H014 installed package @lernapps/app-templates (arc42 cannot resolve untracked paths, docToolchain/arc42-language#128)
:::
:::building-block
id: bb-component-rules
title: Component rules
parent: bb-runtime
technology: TypeScript, Vue SFC compiler
implements: concept-component-rules
:::
```

#### Component rules interface

The validation of an archetype with components runs the checks on its components.

```arc42
:::ignore H014 installed package @lernapps/app-templates (arc42 cannot resolve untracked paths, docToolchain/arc42-language#128)
:::
:::interface
id: if-component-rules
title: The code checks of a component (codeProblems, with the archetype's scope)
provider: bb-component-rules
protocol: TypeScript imports (runtime/shared/vue-code.ts)
:::
```

## Tooling helpers

Built. The parts of `@lernapps/tooling` every app uses, so that rules, helpers and guidance reach the app through
updates without edits: the preset (`archetypes/shared/preset.ts`: lint with the lernapps rules, type check, format,
unit tests, the pre-commit staged files, a build with relative URLs); the lint rules (`lint/rules`: learner texts
German, no request before a click, storage through the wrapper, the Vue component rules); `lernapps check` (`check/`:
accessible, usable at 360 px, no request before a click, no tracking, links and entry links resolve, and the
end-to-end tests before a push); the Playwright configuration (`archetypes/shared/playwright.ts`: Chromium at desktop
width and 360 px on a free port); the small storage (`archetypes/shared/storage.ts`); the announcer and focus helpers
(`archetypes/shared/a11y.ts`); and i18n (`archetypes/shared/i18n.ts`). The skills are a block of their own
(`bb-skills`), which the tooling's `skills/` folder is the source of. A large storage (IndexedDB) is left out (`dec-small-storage`).

```arc42
:::ignore H014 @lernapps/tooling is installed in node_modules (node_modules/@lernapps/tooling), which git does not track, and the validator resolves paths only among tracked files (E011)
:::
:::building-block
id: bb-tooling
title: Tooling helpers
technology: TypeScript, vite-plus, Playwright (@lernapps/tooling, an optional peer of this package)
implements: concept-accessibility, concept-component-rules, concept-device-storage, concept-languages, concept-readable-without-js
:::
```

### Preset interface

The app's vite.config.ts calls `lernapps({ plugins: [<archetype>()] })`; the archetype's runtime uses the preset for
its own Vite servers.

```arc42
:::ignore H014 the interface is in @lernapps/tooling, installed in the untracked node_modules (archetypes/shared/preset.ts)
:::
:::interface
id: if-preset
title: lernapps() preset
provider: bb-tooling
protocol: TypeScript import, @lernapps/tooling/preset
:::
```

### Check command

The creator's assistant, the pre-push hook and CI run `lernapps check`; its report names each rule that failed.
`arc42 validate` in the check is decided, not built.

```arc42
:::ignore H014 the interface is in @lernapps/tooling, installed in the untracked node_modules (check/)
:::
:::interface
id: if-lernapps-check
title: lernapps check command
provider: bb-tooling
protocol: CLI, validation report
:::
```

### Device storage interface

Load, save and remove JSON values through `createStorage`, under the app's prefix in `localStorage`; every access is
wrapped, so the app keeps working when storage is blocked or full. The decided quota of 100 kB per app is not built.

```arc42
:::ignore H014 the interface is in @lernapps/tooling, installed in the untracked node_modules (archetypes/shared/storage.ts)
:::
:::interface
id: if-device-storage
title: createStorage(app)
provider: bb-tooling
protocol: TypeScript import, @lernapps/tooling/storage
:::
```

### Accessibility helpers interface

Announcements through the polite live region, focus moves and the reduced-motion query; the end-to-end tests read the
same live region.

```arc42
:::ignore H014 the interface is in @lernapps/tooling, installed in the untracked node_modules (archetypes/shared/a11y.ts)
:::
:::interface
id: if-a11y
title: announce, moveFocus, prefersReducedMotion
provider: bb-tooling
protocol: TypeScript import, @lernapps/tooling/a11y
:::
```

### Translator interface

Code that shows learner texts gets them through `translator(messages)`, never as strings in code.

```arc42
:::ignore H014 the interface is in @lernapps/tooling, installed in the untracked node_modules (archetypes/shared/i18n.ts)
:::
:::interface
id: if-translator
title: translator(messages)
provider: bb-tooling
protocol: TypeScript import, @lernapps/tooling/i18n
:::
```

## Skills

Built in the tooling, one folder per skill. An app commits its skills under `.agents/skills/`: `lernapps-app` for
every app; the archetype's skill (`lernapps-quiz`, `lernapps-explainer` or `lernapps-interactive`); the content
skills (`lernapps-content-research`, `lernapps-exercise-patterns`, `lernapps-content-growth`); `lernapps-listing`;
and the app's own content guide `app-content`. `lernapps update` installs and replaces the `lernapps-*` skills from
the tooling's `skills/` folder and leaves the app's own alone. They hold the guidance no check can make
(`dec-skill-interface`).

```arc42
:::ignore H014 the skills are committed in each app under .agents/skills; this repository has none
:::
:::building-block
id: bb-skills
title: Skills
technology: Markdown skills (SKILL.md), from the skills/ folder of @lernapps/tooling
implements: concept-low-stimulation
:::
```

### Skills interface

The creator's assistant loads `lernapps-app` when it starts work on an app, and its archetype's skill and the content
skills before it writes what the archetype lets it write.

```arc42
:::ignore H014 the skills are committed in each app under .agents/skills; this repository has none
:::
:::interface
id: if-skills
title: Skill texts (lernapps-app, the archetype's skill, the content skills, app-content)
provider: bb-skills
protocol: Markdown (SKILL.md) loaded by the assistant
:::
```


The interactive archetype's extension of the generic architecture (`docs/arc42/` at the root of
`lernapps/app-templates`): an app whose doing is the content, with a static start page, one app page on which the
shell runs the app's deterministic core and shows its state with the app's Vue components, and hash routes for modes
and levels. The runtime `runtime/interactive/` ships the build step, the pages, the shell and the end-to-end tests; the
creator writes the description, the core, the UI, the data, the messages and the playthroughs, and `src/main.ts`, which
calls `startInteractive`. It reuses the explainer's component rules; the tutor handoff, task numbers, exercise contract
and the examples check are not built for it (its playthroughs take the examples' role). Only the start page reads
without JavaScript. An interactive app adds its own blocks below `bb-interactive-core`, `bb-interactive-ui` and
`bb-interactive-data`: an app gets this architecture as a copy, and writes its own part between the markers
`<!-- app: begin … -->` and `<!-- app: end … -->` in it (here inside the sections of the core, the UI and the data and
at the end of each chapter), which the tooling keeps when it replaces the rest. The creator's assistant follows the
skill `lernapps-interactive` (`if-skills`).

## Interactive runtime

Built. The runtime of every interactive app, which the app does not change: it builds the pages, runs the build
checks, starts the app's core and UI in the browser and brings the end-to-end tests.

```arc42
:::ignore H014 installed package @lernapps/app-templates (arc42 cannot resolve untracked paths, docToolchain/arc42-language#128)
:::
:::building-block
id: bb-archetype-runtime
title: Interactive runtime
technology: TypeScript, Vite plugin, Vue
requires: if-shared-runtime, if-preset, if-component-rules
implements: concept-archetype-extension
:::
```

### Build step

Built. The plugin `interactive()` reads `src/app.yaml` and the playthroughs, runs the component rules on the UI, loads
the core in a Vite server of its own and checks its exports and that every route starts, plays every playthrough
against the core twice, each step's inputs through `step` and then its ticks through `tick(state, 20)`, and fails when
the two plays differ or a state differs from the expected one, and only then writes the start page, the app page and
the 404 page. No time passes but the ticks a step names. An app's code has no size limit (`dec-no-size-limit`).

```arc42
:::ignore H014 installed package @lernapps/app-templates (arc42 cannot resolve untracked paths, docToolchain/arc42-language#128)
:::
:::building-block
id: bb-build
title: Build step
parent: bb-archetype-runtime
technology: Vite plugin
requires: if-archetype-content, if-playthrough-format, if-core-contract, if-component-rules
implements: concept-playthroughs, concept-determinism
:::
```

#### Build plugin interface

The app's vite.config.ts adds `interactive()` to the tooling preset; that is the only way the app enters the build.

```arc42
:::ignore H014 installed package @lernapps/app-templates (arc42 cannot resolve untracked paths, docToolchain/arc42-language#128)
:::
:::interface
id: if-build-plugin
title: interactive() Vite plugin
provider: bb-build
protocol: TypeScript import, @lernapps/app-templates/interactive/plugin
:::
```

### Description validation

Built. Validates `src/app.yaml` and every playthrough against their JSON schemas, then German first, complete
languages, unique ids, at least one playthrough, each step expecting something, and known routes; one line per
problem with file and line.

```arc42
:::ignore H014 installed package @lernapps/app-templates (arc42 cannot resolve untracked paths, docToolchain/arc42-language#128)
:::
:::building-block
id: bb-validation
title: Description validation
parent: bb-archetype-runtime
technology: Ajv, JSON Schema, YAML
requires: if-archetype-content, if-playthrough-format, if-runtime-texts
:::
```

### Page rendering

Built. Renders, in each language, the start page (what the app does, the link into the app, the routes, how to play,
competencies, background sections, a `<noscript>` note and no script) and the app page (title, `<noscript>` note with
a link back, the routes as anchor links, and the element the shell mounts into, carrying the route ids).

```arc42
:::ignore H014 installed package @lernapps/app-templates (arc42 cannot resolve untracked paths, docToolchain/arc42-language#128)
:::
:::building-block
id: bb-render
title: Page rendering
parent: bb-archetype-runtime
technology: TypeScript, HTML
requires: if-archetype-content, if-runtime-texts
implements: concept-readable-without-js, concept-hash-routes, concept-accessibility
:::
```

#### Pages interface

Learners, teachers and parents read the start page at `lernapps.net/<repo>/` and play at
`app/?seed=<n>#<route>`; the catalog entry's topics link to the routes.

```arc42
:::ignore H014 installed package @lernapps/app-templates (arc42 cannot resolve untracked paths, docToolchain/arc42-language#128)
:::
:::interface
id: if-pages
title: Start page and app page app/?seed=<n>#<route>
provider: bb-render
protocol: HTML pages over HTTPS (query and hash)
:::
```

### Shell

Built. `startInteractive(core, root)` mounts the root component on the app page and holds the core's state; it takes
the seed from `?seed=<n>` (else a random one) and the route from the hash (else the first route), starts the core
again on a new route, calls `tick(state, 20)` every 20 ms when the core has `tick`, and routes typed inputs to `step`
(`dec-typed-input`): every key typed on the page as a key input, except on links, buttons and form fields or with
Ctrl, Alt or Meta, and every input the root component emits as `input` (an action, or a key it stands for). When the
end-to-end tests' clock is on the page (`if-test-clock`), it starts no interval and steps the ticks the tests ask for.

The app page has a heading line: the h1, the app's title, and a slot beside it, hidden and empty. An app that wants a
small control there (help, sound off) passes a component as `startInteractive(core, App, { title })`; the shell
mounts it into the slot with the props `state` and `lang` and the same `input` event as the root component, and shows
the slot. The header of both pages holds the language switch and nothing else, and an app with one language has none:
the title is the h1, and the way back to the catalog is the platform's. The frame of the header, the page and the
footer is as wide as the custom property `--page-max-width` (default `44rem`), which an app sets in its own
`:root` rule.

```arc42
:::ignore H014 installed package @lernapps/app-templates (arc42 cannot resolve untracked paths, docToolchain/arc42-language#128)
:::
:::building-block
id: bb-shell
title: Shell
parent: bb-archetype-runtime
technology: TypeScript, Vue, DOM events
requires: if-core-contract, if-root-component
implements: concept-core-and-shell, concept-hash-routes, concept-determinism
:::
```

#### Start interface

The app's `src/main.ts` imports the runtime's style, the core and the root component and calls `startInteractive`.

```arc42
:::ignore H014 installed package @lernapps/app-templates (arc42 cannot resolve untracked paths, docToolchain/arc42-language#128)
:::
:::interface
id: if-start
title: startInteractive(core, root, options?)
provider: bb-shell
protocol: TypeScript import, @lernapps/app-templates/interactive
:::
```

#### Test clock

Before the client module runs, the end-to-end tests put an object on the page as the global `lernappsClock`; the
shell then starts no interval and gives that object `tick(count)`, which calls the shell's own tick `count` times. No
time passes in the browser but the ticks a playthrough step names, as in the build. Only the tests set it.

```arc42
:::ignore H014 installed package @lernapps/app-templates (arc42 cannot resolve untracked paths, docToolchain/arc42-language#128)
:::
:::interface
id: if-test-clock
title: lernappsClock, the end-to-end tests' clock
provider: bb-shell
protocol: global object with tick(count)
:::
```

#### State property

The shell mirrors the state on the app's element as `lernappsState`, which the end-to-end tests read.

```arc42
:::ignore H014 installed package @lernapps/app-templates (arc42 cannot resolve untracked paths, docToolchain/arc42-language#128)
:::
:::interface
id: if-state-property
title: lernappsState on the app element
provider: bb-shell
protocol: DOM property
:::
```

### End-to-end tests

Built. `interactiveTests()` checks the start page and the app page without JavaScript in every language and plays
every playthrough's steps in the browser on the test clock (`if-test-clock`): a key input pressed on the keyboard, an
action emitted as `input` by the root component, as the component itself does, then the step's ticks; after each step
it compares the state and the polite announcement, at desktop width and 360 px.

```arc42
:::ignore H014 installed package @lernapps/app-templates (arc42 cannot resolve untracked paths, docToolchain/arc42-language#128)
:::
:::building-block
id: bb-e2e

parent: bb-archetype-runtime
technology: Playwright
requires: if-archetype-content, if-playthrough-format, if-state-property, if-test-clock, if-runtime-texts, if-a11y
implements: concept-playthroughs
:::
```

#### Tests interface

The app's `e2e/interactive.e2e.ts` only calls `interactiveTests()`.

```arc42
:::ignore H014 installed package @lernapps/app-templates (arc42 cannot resolve untracked paths, docToolchain/arc42-language#128)
:::
:::interface
id: if-e2e-tests
title: interactiveTests()
provider: bb-e2e
protocol: TypeScript import, @lernapps/app-templates/interactive/e2e
:::
```

### Runtime texts

Built. The runtime's own learner texts in German and English; an app may declare only these languages.

```arc42
:::ignore H014 installed package @lernapps/app-templates (arc42 cannot resolve untracked paths, docToolchain/arc42-language#128)
:::
:::building-block
id: bb-runtime-texts
title: Runtime texts
parent: bb-archetype-runtime
technology: JSON per language
implements: concept-languages
:::
```

#### Runtime texts interface

The pages, the validation and the tests take the runtime's texts by key and language.

```arc42
:::ignore H014 installed package @lernapps/app-templates (arc42 cannot resolve untracked paths, docToolchain/arc42-language#128)
:::
:::interface
id: if-runtime-texts
title: Runtime texts by language
provider: bb-runtime-texts
protocol: TypeScript import, JSON
:::
```

## Description

Built in the template: `src/app.yaml` says what the start page shows, the languages and the routes.

```arc42
:::building-block
id: bb-interactive-description
title: Description
technology: YAML
path: src/app.yaml
:::
```

### App description interface

The interactive archetype's content: the build, the validation, the pages and the tests read the app's description
only through this schema.

```arc42
:::ignore H014 installed package @lernapps/app-templates (arc42 cannot resolve untracked paths, docToolchain/arc42-language#128)
:::
:::interface
id: if-archetype-content

## Core

Built in the template. The app's logic, pure TypeScript without DOM, deterministic by its seed, its state plain JSON,
so that it can be played and tested in Node and in the browser alike; it reads the app's data.

```arc42
:::building-block
id: bb-interactive-core
title: Core
technology: TypeScript
requires: if-interactive-data
implements: concept-core-and-shell, concept-determinism
path: src/core
:::
```

### Core contract

The core exports `start(seed, route)`, `step(state, input)` and, when the app moves on its own, `tick(state, dt)`.
The input is typed and extensible (`dec-typed-input`): `{ kind: "key", key }` with the key as `KeyboardEvent.key`, or
`{ kind: "action", name, value? }` for what the learner does with the pointer or by touch; a core handles the kinds it
knows and returns the state unchanged for any other, so new kinds can come.

```arc42
:::ignore H014 installed package @lernapps/app-templates (arc42 cannot resolve untracked paths, docToolchain/arc42-language#128)
:::
:::interface
id: if-core-contract
title: Core contract start, step, tick
provider: bb-interactive-core
protocol: TypeScript module exports
:::
```

<!-- app: begin core -->

### Game state interface

The components read the state of the game, with the trainer's advice and the tree inside it, and the helper that lists
the fields of a game. They never calculate chances themselves.

```arc42
:::interface
id: if-kt-state
title: State of the game (types and helpers)
provider: bb-interactive-core
protocol: TypeScript module exports
path: src/core/index.ts
:::
```

### Scoring and fractions

The thirteen fields of the sheet, what five dice score in each (`scoring.ts`) and exact fractions for the chances (`fraction.ts`), so that learners see 11/36 and never 0.3055. The fields and their averages come from the data.

```arc42
:::building-block
id: bb-kt-scoring
title: Scoring and fractions
parent: bb-interactive-core
technology: TypeScript
requires: if-interactive-data
path: src/core/scoring.ts
:::
```

#### Scoring interface

What the chance engine and the game flow ask the scoring: the points of five dice in a field.

```arc42
:::interface
id: if-kt-scoring
title: score(dice, field) and fractions
provider: bb-kt-scoring
protocol: TypeScript module exports
path: src/core/scoring.ts
:::
```

### Chance engine

Tries every outcome of throwing the dice again: the value of five dice with throws left is the best of stopping and of each hold, counted over the 252 distinct sets of dice. It is the only place that searches; the trainer asks it.

```arc42
:::building-block
id: bb-kt-engine
title: Chance engine
parent: bb-interactive-core
technology: TypeScript
implements: concept-determinism
path: src/core/engine.ts
:::
```

#### Engine interface

The trainer gives a payoff and the dice and gets what stopping and each hold are worth.

```arc42
:::interface
id: if-kt-engine
title: evaluate(payoff, dice, rollsLeft)
provider: bb-kt-engine
protocol: TypeScript module exports
path: src/core/engine.ts
:::
```

### Trainer

Turns the engine's values into advice for one turn: the dice to keep, the field to aim for (above its average), the rings with their exact fractions and the probability tree (`advice.ts`, `odds.ts`). It looks at one turn, not the game.

```arc42
:::building-block
id: bb-kt-trainer
title: Trainer
parent: bb-interactive-core
technology: TypeScript
requires: if-kt-engine, if-kt-scoring
path: src/core/advice.ts
:::
```

#### Trainer interface

The game flow asks for the advice of the current dice; the tree component draws the tree it contains.

```arc42
:::interface
id: if-kt-advice
title: adviseFor(dice, rollsLeft, open) and the tree
provider: bb-kt-trainer
protocol: TypeScript module exports
path: src/core/advice.ts
:::
```

### Game flow

The state of a game and what each input does: choose the length, throw, hold, enter a field, pause, the joker's levels and answers, the coach's views, the end. Dice come from the seed (`index.ts`); the plain game gets no advice.

```arc42
:::building-block
id: bb-kt-game
title: Game flow
parent: bb-interactive-core
technology: TypeScript
requires: if-kt-advice, if-kt-scoring
implements: concept-core-and-shell, concept-determinism
path: src/core/index.ts

## UI

Built in the template. Vue components that show the state and translate the device's input (keys, pointer, touch, …)
into inputs; free in how they render (DOM, SVG, canvas). They may remember something through the small storage; the
template does not.

```arc42
:::building-block
id: bb-interactive-ui
title: UI
technology: Vue single-file components
requires: if-a11y, if-translator, if-messages
implements: concept-component-rules, concept-accessibility
path: src/ui
:::
```

### Root component

The root component takes the props `state` and `lang` and emits `input` with an input (an action, or a key).

```arc42
:::ignore H014 the contract has no file of its own: its props are set in runtime/interactive/interactive.ts (if-start's file), the component is the app's
:::
:::interface
id: if-root-component
title: Root component (state, lang, input)
provider: bb-interactive-ui
protocol: Vue props and events
:::
```

<!-- app: begin ui -->

### Table

The setup, the table with the dice and the score block, the pause and the end with the high scores. It remembers only the best five games per length (points and day, no name) through the small storage (`App.vue`, `DiceRow.vue`, `SheetBlock.vue`). The whole app fills the screen over the page's frame; the mode links of the setup, the Info link, Escape and the Pause button lead out.

```arc42
:::building-block
id: bb-kt-table
title: Table
parent: bb-interactive-ui
technology: Vue single-file components
requires: if-kt-state, if-device-storage
path: src/ui/App.vue
:::
```

### Coach, joker and feedback

The explanation card with chances, the way they come about and the advice; the joker that asks the learner to fill in the tree; the feedback on the last move (`CoachCard.vue`, `JokerCard.vue`, `FeedbackCard.vue`). They show what the trainer worked out and emit actions; they calculate nothing themselves.

```arc42
:::building-block
id: bb-kt-help
title: Coach, joker and feedback
parent: bb-interactive-ui
technology: Vue single-file components
requires: if-kt-state, if-kt-tree
path: src/ui/CoachCard.vue
:::
```

### Probability tree

Draws the tree of the core as SVG: where branches, nodes and results go (`treeLayout.ts`) and which chances show their value or a question mark (`TreeView.vue`). One drawing for the coach and for all three levels of the joker.

```arc42
:::building-block
id: bb-kt-tree
title: Probability tree
parent: bb-interactive-ui
technology: Vue single-file component, SVG
requires: if-kt-state
path: src/ui/TreeView.vue
:::
```

#### Tree component interface

The coach and the joker give the tree and say which chances show their value.

```arc42
:::interface
id: if-kt-tree
title: TreeView props (tree, lang, reveal)
provider: bb-kt-tree
protocol: Vue props
path: src/ui/TreeView.vue
:::
```

```arc42

## Data

Built in the template. The app's content as data in its own format (lessons, texts with their faulty versions).

```arc42
:::building-block
id: bb-interactive-data
title: Data
technology: JSON
path: src/data
:::
```

### App data

The core imports the data files as JSON modules, so they are bundled and checked with the core.

```arc42
:::interface
id: if-interactive-data
title: Data files (JSON imports)
provider: bb-interactive-data
protocol: JSON module import
path: src/data
:::
```

<!-- app: begin data -->
<!-- app: end data -->

## Messages

Built in the template. The app's learner texts by language, read through the translator.

```arc42
:::building-block
id: bb-interactive-messages
title: Messages
technology: JSON
implements: concept-languages
path: src/messages
:::
```

### Message files

The UI imports one message file per language and hands it to the translator.

```arc42
:::interface
id: if-messages
title: Message files by language
provider: bb-interactive-messages
protocol: JSON module import
path: src/messages
:::
```

## Playthroughs

Built in the template. Playthroughs as data: a seed, a route and steps of inputs (`keys` as the short form of key
inputs, or `inputs`) and ticks that pass after them, with the state or announcement expected after each step. The
template's playthrough lets a letter go late and starts a round with the action `again`.

```arc42
:::building-block
id: bb-interactive-playthroughs
title: Playthroughs
technology: YAML
implements: concept-playthroughs
path: src/playthroughs
:::
```

### Playthrough format

The build and the end-to-end tests read playthroughs in this format.

```arc42
:::ignore H014 installed package @lernapps/app-templates (arc42 cannot resolve untracked paths, docToolchain/arc42-language#128)
:::
:::interface
id: if-playthrough-format
title: Playthrough (playthrough.v1 schema)
provider: bb-interactive-playthroughs
protocol: YAML, JSON Schema
:::
```
